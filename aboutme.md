## BREAK into program

Here you will find contents about programming, device hacking, and all kind of computer universe related stuff.

I'm not a native English spoken guy, but I'll try to do my best effort to write without mistakes. I know some people will blame me for not writing in Spanish... It's true there is little technical content written in Spanish, but hey!, which language do you use when you search for help in the Internet??. English is the most global language of the web. I've learned a lot from the global community, so I expect this to be a global contribution.

In any case, I don't earn any money with this website, so practicing and learning some English in my spare time is the only payback I expect.

### OK, but this blog's title sounds familiar to me...

Hmm... then you are at least as old as I am.

'L BREAK into program' was an error found in ancient Spectrum computers. This was shown when the BREAK key was pressed to gain access to a running program.

OK, now press BREAK, stop for a while and take a rest to think about how things work.
